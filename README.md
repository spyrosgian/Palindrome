# Palindrome
This is a Git repository that contains the python script for 
Part 2 of Assignment 2 of _Introduction in Python Programming_ Part Time Course of Cardiff University.

A Python script, named palindrome.py, which examines a string of alphabetic characters type in at the keyboard and tests
whether the string is a palindrome. (i.e. the string reads the sameforwards as it does backwards.)

The program starta by first outputting "Please enter string" and the user should then input a string of up to 10 characters from
the keyboard followed by the RETURN key.

If more than 10 characters are entered via the keyboard, the program outputa the message "String too long" and exits.

If anon-alphabetic character is entered via the keyboard, the program outputs the message "Invalid input" and exits.

If the input is valid, the program tests whether the string is apalindrome and outputs either the message "String is a palindrome"
or the message "String is not a palindrome".
